## Simulation 1:
Once added conversion functions, a first test is performed testing each of the methods, thus enabling functions like Addition, Substraction, "and" and "or" between inputs A and B. A and B values were varied to show different situations.

## Simulation 2:
Added xor, addition of 4 (constant), and shift left of 2 bits.

## Simulation 3:
Added cases of comparations: A greater than B, equals B, lower than B.

## Simulation 4:
Testing overflow using unsigned operads.
